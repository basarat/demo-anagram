# Algorithm to determine if two strings are an anagram
> The anagram test is commonly used to demonstrate how an naivie implementation can perform significant order of magnitues slower than an efficient one.

```js
/**
 * A word is an anagram of another if you can rearrange its characters to produce the second word. 
 * Given two strings determine if they are anagrams of each other.
 * - 'earth' and 'heart' are anagrams
 * - 'silent' and 'listen' are anagrams

We will start by creating our areAnagrams function 

```js
function areAnagrams(s1: string, s2: string) {
}
```
