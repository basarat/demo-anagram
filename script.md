> Using ES6 and ESNext with TypeScript
> TypeScript is very particular about what is and isn't allowed in a TS file to protect you from common developer errors. By default if you set the compile target to ES5 it only allows you to use globally defined variables that were availble in the ES5 timeframe. That said it is super easy to configure TypeScrit to use ES6 or even ESNext using the `lib` option. We also cover how to make sure that these features work across the widest range of browsers.
