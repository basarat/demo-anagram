> Coding Interview: FizzBuzz

> The FizzBuzz problem is commonly presented as the lowest level of comprehension required to illustrate adequacy in computer programming.

> In this lesson you learn about the problem as well as its solution in TypeScript.

You can define a variable in TypeScript using `var`, `let`, `const`, `function`, `class`, `namespace`, `enum`.

```js
/**
 * Write a program that prints the integers from 1 to 100 (inclusive).
 * But:
 *  - for multiples of three, print Fizz (instead of the number)
 *  - for multiples of five, print Buzz (instead of the number)
 *  - for multiples of both three and five, print FizzBuzz (instead of the number)
 */
```
It is always a good idea in a coding interview to do a quick run of expected results without actually writing any code.

Here you can go ahead and write down the expected results upfront:

```js
/**
 * 1
 * 2
 * Fizz
 * 4
 * Buzz
 * Fizz
 * 7
 * 8
 * Fizz
 * Buzz
 * 11
 * Fizz
 * 13
 * 14
 * FizzBuzz
 */
```
